## Hi! I'm Saran 👋
 
- 🔭 I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Colgate University, where I built a strong foundation in software engineering and AI research.
- 🤖 I’m currently developing a recommender-focused app that combines data insights with user experience (reach out to chat about it!).
- 💡 I’m passionate about building data-driven, user-centered products that turn complex problems into simple, meaningful solutions.
- 🌱 Currently learning more about scalable architectures and product strategy.
- 👯 Open to collaboration and opportunities in product, data, and AI.
- ⚡ Outside of tech, I love going on walks, working out, and discovering new music.
